The Bank Management System allows users to perform various banking tasks without the need for a login system. Users can create an account by providing their name, account number, and type (either savings or current) along with an initial deposit amount. After account creation, users can deposit and withdraw money by providing their account number and entering the desired amount.

The system also enables users to check their account balance, view a list of all account holders, modify their account details, and even close their account. The project uses classes and file handling features in C++ to store and manage user data in an external DAT file.

Overall, the Bank Management System provides a comprehensive set of features for managing bank accounts in a user-friendly and efficient manner.
